From v0.5 includes the Console Filter extension previously available separately from the Console² website.","fullDescription":"As of Firefox 1.5, the JavaScript Console is used not only for JavaScript errors, but for CSS errors as well. This extension takes this into account by providing a simple possibility to display errors by type.\n\nConsole² let's you display errors filtered by type (Errors, Warnings, Messages), language (JavaScript, CSS, XML) and context (Chrome, Content). Furthermore it provides a simple search box (as seen in the History and Bookmarks sidebars), hiding of duplicates, sidebar optimizations, a customizable toolbar and some more accessibility improvements.\n\nFrom v0.5 includes the Console Filter extension previously available separately from the Console² website.\n\n* To use the Console Filter searchbox, right click on a toolbar in the Console² window and select \"Customize...\". Then drag the CF searchbox on to a Console² toolbar.\n\n* The filter syntax is basically \"Google Lite\" The messages in the console are searched for all terms entered (AND search), but must not contain any terms preceded by a minus sign (NOT search). Terms inside quotations marks must be found in that order (exact phrase).\n\nerror -expect \"declaration dropped\"\n\n* For more on the filter syntax please see http://console2.mozdev.org/cf/index.html\n\nLatest release: Console² 0.9\nThis release version works with Firefox 3.0 to 11.0, Thunderbird 3.0 to 11.0, SeaMonkey 2.0 to 2.8, and most probably the current trunk/branch nightlies.\n\nWhat's New\n* [new] Message FIFO limit is now controlled by a hidden preference \"extensions.console2.max-errors\" currently 1000. (Patch by Kris Maglione).\n* [new] Enable blocklist domains from resource:// URLs\n[new] Enable filter for \"resource://\" URLs\n[fix] Alias resource:/// to resource://app/ to allow these resource urls to be filtered and blocklisted.\n(Patches by titoBouzout).\n* [fix] Use white-space: pre-wrap for the console message descriptions to allow newlines and formatted messages (Patch by titoBouzout).\n* [new] Add support for Komodo alphas appversion >= 6.9 (Patch by titoBouzout).\n* [fix] css problems with textonly toolbarbuttons in icon mode toolbars.\n* [new] Show timestamps if available from nsIScriptError/nsIScriptError2.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/13/13226.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"200","height":"150","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/13/13226.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Peek preview of Console²"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/13/13227.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"700","height":"338","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/13/13227.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"96","caption":"A first impression of Console²"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/32/32383.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"660","height":"375","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/32/32383.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"113","caption":"Console² works with the Console Filter extension."}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/console%C2%B2/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://console2.mozdev.org/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/139488/console2-0.9-fx+tb+sb+sm+fn.xpi?src=api","size":108544,"contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/console%C2%B2/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":"$3.00","developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/console%C2%B2/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":45,"totalDownloads":1490562,"weeklyDownloads":270,"dailyUsers":13466,"updateDate":1324450291000,"supportURL":"http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=577627"},{"id":"DevPrefs@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/483/483493-32.png?modified=1403832544","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/483/483493-64.png?modified=1403832544"},"name":"DevPrefs","type":"extension","version":"1.3","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Noitidart","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/user/Noitidart/?src=api"},"description":"Automatically sets all preferences for Firefox addon developer production environment.","fullDescription":"The preferences defined on MDN page, \"Setting up an extension development environment\", as of February 5, 2014 are set up on install/enable of addon.
